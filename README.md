## Use

Once you have installed the library, you can create the header value by calling the appropriate `\Akamai\Open\Edgegrid\Authentication::set*()` methods.

For example, using it with the built-in streams HTTP client might look like the following:

```php
$auth = \Akamai\Open\EdgeGrid\Authentication::createFromEdgeRcFile('default', '/.edgerc');
$auth->setHttpMethod('GET');
$auth->setPath('/identity-management/v3/user-profile');

$context = array(
  'http' => array(
    'header' => array(
      'Authorization: ' . $auth->createAuthHeader(),
      'Content-Type: application/json'
    )
  )
);

$context = stream_context_create($context);

$response = json_decode(file_get_contents('https://' . $auth->getHost() . $auth->getPath(), null, $context));
```
